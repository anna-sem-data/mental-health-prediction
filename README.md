# 🧠 Mental Health Risk Detection from Social Media

This project applies natural language processing and machine learning to detect potential mental health risks from social media posts. By combining sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and predictive modeling, the system aims to identify individuals who may be at risk based on the tone and content of their text.
